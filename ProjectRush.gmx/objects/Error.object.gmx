Fix slime AI to hop to *selected* foe.
Compressed code would be amazesome, but I don't know how to go about it.
Current thoughts: create parents known as "player1", "player2",... etc and target them
towards "player"+playerindex &lt;- concatenated. Would this woirk?
--I have tried and found no way to reference an object by its name as a string, as such
--I have no way to make a theoretically infinite amount of players, as that would
--currently require an infintie switch statement.

Slime blood splatters towards player- I understand the logic, but it would look better
going the other way, with only a few splatters going towards the player.
--Understandable, origionally the slime was intended to be attacked with a sword, not a 
--bullet- will fix

Actually, this is a problem ^
it splatters towards player 1. Needs to splatter towards bullet owner or bullet entry 
if anything, because p2 gets some hilarious results

Main menu/settings.
This is a biggie. Working on it.

Controller prob'ms:
Direction defaults to 0 on movement.

Networking. port 6516-6518 is what we'll be using.
